    "Determining a robot’s orientation and position in a known environment, also known as localization, is a critical problem in the field of robotics. As is common in robotics, this seemingly simple problem is surprisingly difficult, and remains an active research area. In this lab, you will solve robotic localization by implementing Monte Carlo Localization (aka MCL, particle filter, or recursive bayes filter).\n",

While it is not strictly necessary for your particle filter to function (since the normalization step reweights particles), ideally $p(z_{t}^{k}|x_t, m)$ integrates to 1, given that it is a probability. It can be tricky to define the sum of four terms such that it always adds to 1, so an easy way to handle this is to simply normalize the discretized model after precomputation (see below).\n",

This function could be used (along with ray casting) to directly evaluate the likelihood of recording your actual laser scan at each hypothesis pose. However, there’s a better way! \n",
    "Instead of evaluating the function millions of times at runtime, you can evaluate it over a discretized grid of its inputs ($z_{t}^{k}$ and $z_{t}^{k^{\\ast}}$) at initialization time, and store a lookup table. This strategy is described in section 3.4.1 of [2]. The motivation is twofold:\n",
    "1. Reading off a probability value from a table based on your actual sensor measurement and raycast ‘ground truth’ values is MUCH faster than doing all the math every time;\n",

    "### 4. Notes and Tips\n",
    "If you implement the particle filter exactly as described above, you will likely discover that it has very poor performance. Largely, this poor performance is due to assumptions made during the derivation of the particle filter which are not strictly true. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the particle distribution approximates the true distribution in the limit - with an infinite number of particles. Clearly this is problematic since we maintain at max a few thousand particles. You should take a look at [4,5] for some useful tips for improving real world problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to downsample the number of range measurements from the particle filter from >1000 to less than 100. This will make the probability distribution over your state space less “peaked” and increase the number of particles you can maintain in real time (less ray casting). Additionally, you will probably want to “squash” your sensor model output probability by raising it to a power of less than one (1/3 for example) to make your distribution even less peaked. If your are confused by this paragraph, look at [4,5]. \n",
    "Similarly, you may notice that the TA sensor model table shown above is not as peaked as you might expect given the LiDAR accuracy (namely the “hit” term in [question 2 of part A](#question2)) . This is largely to smooth the probability distribution over the particle state space so that the convergence basin of the algorithm is larger.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Writing efficient Python\n",
    "Since the algorithm must run at >20Hz with a large number of particles, an efficient implementation is a requirement for success. There are a few tricks you can use, primarily:\n",
    "-   Use numpy arrays for absolutely everything - python lists → slow\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use numpy functions on numpy arrays to do any computations, \n",
    "    - avoid Python for loops like the plague\n",
    "    -   [Slice indexing is your (best) friend.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html)\n",

    "    -   Be careful! Avoid bugs due to stale state in reused variables!\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Identify your critical code paths, and keep them clean\n",
    "    - Conversely, don’t worry too much about code that is called infrequently\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Push code to Cython/C++ if necessary\n",
    "    -   You probably won’t need to do this much since RangeLibc already does this\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Avoid excessive function calls - function call overhead in Python → slow\n",

    "-   Use RangeLibc\n",

    "Assuming a reasonably efficient architecture, you will find that the bottleneck computation in running your particle filter is the determination of ground truth ranges between hypothesis poses (particles) and the nearest obstacles in the map - ray casting. Rather than having you implement the “calc_range” function yourself in Python, we provide the RangeLibc library to enable real time particle filter operation. See [RangeLibc document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NSRAAZhNbmrsyQynYBgQuT2EUYupjg3Qafu1OtkTYtc/export?format=pdf) for an algorithm overview and usage instructions. We highly recommend you read through it since it includes tips to make your sensor model implementations significantly simpler and faster."
