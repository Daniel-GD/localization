    "Determining a robot’s orientation and position in a known environment, also known as localization, is a critical problem in the field of robotics. As is common in robotics, this seemingly simple problem is surprisingly difficult, and remains an active research area. In this lab, you will solve robotic localization by implementing Monte Carlo Localization (aka MCL or particle filter).\n",

The motion model, $g$, takes as arguments the old particle pose, $\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}$, as well as the current odometry data, $\\Delta\\mathbf{x}$, and returns a new pose, $\\mathbf{x}_t$ with the odometry “applied” to the old poses:\n",

This accounts for any uncertainty that exists in the odometry information. The sensor model will collapse this spreading of particles back into a small region."

We will use this likelihood to \"prune\" the particles as the motion model tries to spread them out.

You may assume that the motor commands relate to the movement of your car according to the [geometric Ackermann model](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2009/2/Automatic_Steering_Methods_for_Autonomous_Automobile_Path_Tracking.pdf), with some noise due to tire slip and other imperfections.

So rather than evaluating this function millions of times at runtime, you can evaluate it on a discretized grid of inputs $z_t$ and $z_t^*$ and store these values in a lookup table.\n",

When the test completes (or is terminated early) the autograder will output a `log.npz` file that contains this trajectory data, which you need to upload to Gradescope.

    "- Downsample your laser scan: you lidar has > 1000 beams but many of them are redundant. Downsample to ~100 for good performance. This will make the probability distribution over your state space less \"peaked\" and increase the number of particles you can maintain in real time (less ray casting).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also to make your probability distribution less peaked you could also try to \"squash\" your sensor model output probability by raising it to a power of less than one (1/3 for example) to make your distribution even less peaked. If your are confused by this paragraph, look at [4,5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't go crazy with particles: start with ~200. You can probably get your code running with thousands of particles but it will take some well crafted code to run in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use ```rostopic hz``` to check the rate at which you are publishing control messages. It should be greater than 20hz for realtime performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use numpy arrays for absolutely everything - python lists → slow\n",
    "    - Use numpy functions on numpy arrays to do any computations.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Avoid unnecessary memory allocations\n",
    "    -   Cache and reuse important numpy arrays by setting them to the right size during initialization of your particle filter as “self” variables\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Identify your critical code paths, and keep them clean\n",
    "    - Conversely, don’t worry too much about code that is called infrequently\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Push code to Cython/C++ if necessary\n",

[Cartographer](https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer) is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization and mapping ([SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor configurations.  Please go to [this repository](https://github.com/mit-rss/cartographer_config), follow the instruction to configure and run cartographer on the real RACECAR."
